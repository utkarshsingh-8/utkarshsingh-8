### About Me

- ðŸŒ± Interested in Web Development, Web3 and BlockChain.

- âš¡ Competitive Programming Enthusiast

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love writing on platforms like Quora.


Ever since I was in high school, software development has always fascinated me. Being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing in these funny little symbols, limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity.

This passion carried me through my education at Babu Banarasi Das Northern India Institute of Technology, Lucknow. Getting into a reputed college like BBDNIIT provided an excellent platform for developing the right technical skills and presented me with an abundance of opportunities. Along the way, my love and interest in technology also deepened. I got the chance to realize my current potential and expand the horizon of my skills, pushing the limits farther.

I learned C++, tearing through many online tutorials I could find on anything related to software development. I was insatiable. I studied new languages like Python, got to learn Data structures & algorithms, and pursuing my interest for Blockchain, I dived deeper into the field of Web3 and Blockchain, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid. With the guidance of our faculty and seniors, I got to work in Blockchain technology, which taught me that blockchain technology has the power to bring revolution in the world. It was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn.

My interests include Competitive Programming which taught me patience and improved my Logical thinking and Problem-Solving skills to a great extent.

There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.
